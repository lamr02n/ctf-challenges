## Goal

Log into the game using SSH. Address, port, username and password are given.

---
## Steps taken

1. **Establish SSH connection**: I used the command `ssh -p 2220 username@host` which establishes an SSH connection to the host address. The username can be specified with `username@` before the host. The port number can be entered using the flag `-p`. Then, I entered the given password and was logged into the remote shell.

## New insights and lessons learned

- **Recalling the SSH command**: The structure of the `ssh` command with the @-symbol is different from many commands, that use flags instead. The port number must be specified with a flag. However, due to my background I know the `ssh` command well enough.
- **Relevance for Cybersecurity**: SSH is commonly used to connect to remote hosts. In cybersecurity, this can be a way for attackers to control victim hosts.

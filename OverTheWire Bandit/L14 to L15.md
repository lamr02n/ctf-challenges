## Goal

Submit the obtained password on `localhost:30000`.

---
## Steps taken

1. **Connecting to the port**: As I had already obtained the access as `bandit14` in the last level, I simply tried to connect to the given port. Through university CTF tasks, I am familiar with the `nc` (netcat) command that can be used to connect to specified ports. I tried the simplest version of the command, namely `nc localhost 30000`, to connect. There was no response text, but an input field. I pasted the password obtained in the last level and got a response `Correct!` and the password for `bandit15`.

## New insights and lessons learned

- Although I have used `nc` in many CTF-like challenges at university, it is always interesting to interact with servers you do not know yet. In this challenge, an input field was presented and a response text sent. In others, I needed to communicate with the remote server in a specific way (like sending the correct phrase in the right order and at the right time) to get it to respond. This shows how versatile different services react and it is always fun to find new behaviors.

## Goal

Find the password in a base64-encoded file.

## Steps taken

1. **Research `base64` command**: Before starting the challenge, I looked up the `base64` command on using `man base64`. I immediately saw that there is a flag `-d` for decoding.

## New insights and lessons learned

- **Command `base64`**: As I have already observed in university CTF challenges and when working with software, sometimes information is base64-encoded to easier to handle in transport. Knowing the command `base64` is helpful in dealing with such information. In the past, I often used online converters for base64-encoding and -decoding. The command makes this process much easier.
